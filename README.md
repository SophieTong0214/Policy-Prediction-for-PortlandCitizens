# Policy-Prediction-for-PortlandCitizens

##  **Project Overview**


### Dataset: 
The project utilizes two datasetsâ€”Portland citizen demographic data and a text dataset comprising 389 PDF documents.

### Objectives and Values:
1. Objective: Predict the most advantageous policies for individuals based on demographic attributes and text data.
2. Value: Leverage extensive data resources for analyzing and identifying impactful public policies tailored to individuals' needs and interactions with public services.

### Methodology:
1. Data Collection: Gather Portland citizen demographic data and text documents.
2. Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the text data for analysis.
3. Text Mining: Utilize techniques such as TF-IDF, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and topic modeling to extract insights from the text dataset.
4. Analysis: Apply methods like K-Means clustering and LDA modeling to analyze the data and predict optimal policies.
5. Evaluation: Assess the accuracy and performance of the prediction models.


### Findings and Recommendations:
1. Keyword Optimization: Enhance prediction accuracy by optimizing keywords used in interest classification.
2. Model Refinement: Continuously refine the models based on feedback from domain experts to improve recommendation accuracy.
3. Further Optimization: Despite efforts,the project faces challenges in accurately predicting optimal policies and constructing a targeted recommendation system. Explore additional techniques and strategies to enhance the precision of policy predictions and recommendation systems.
